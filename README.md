**General Description**

BlockWorld is a single and dual-player 2d platformer that allows the player to draw their own level on a cell grid using various preset colors. Depending on which color they choose, their level will have different obstacles and challenges, for example:

Red block : immediate death when touched, character respawns at the start

Blue block : pass through, climbable object when interacted with

Black block : regular boundary block (wall and floor)

They must also place an orange block to indicate the starting position of the characters and a green end block. 

The characters will spawn at the start block and the aim of the game is to survive all the obstacles and get to the end block. 


**How to play**

The game opens up to a screen with a description of how to play the game and the key for the colors used in the map. 

After pressing the start button, the player will be prompted to select whether they want to play with one character or two. After this selection is made the player is redirected to begin drawing their map, adding blue blocks which act as rope, red blocks which act as lava and black blocks which act as boundaries. An orange start block and a green end block must be placed on the map for the user to enter the game state.

Once the user pressed the finished button the level will be drawn and the character(s) will spawn at the orange start block. Using the W/A/S/D keys for the pink player, or the arrow keys for the purple second player, the user must get to the green end block. 

Once the end block is reached, the level has been completed and the end screen will be displayed, giving the user the option to play again.
